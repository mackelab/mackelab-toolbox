"""
Tie-in to the theano_shim module (which I plan on renaming to `cgshim`
if/when it gets extended to other computational graph libraries)

Provides
--------
  - cast_floatX:Â Callable
    Function which casts to current type of 'floatX'
  - Injects the following types into `mackelab_toolbox.typing`:
    Has the elements:
    + FloatX: retrieved as `typing.FloatX`
      A type which maps to `.typing.NPValue[shim.config.floatX]`.
    + Symbolic: retrieved as `typing.Symbolic`
      A type, compatible with pydantic, to indicate a symbolic value in
      annotations. Which type that corresponds to depends on the currently
      loaded symbolic library.
    + Shared: retrieved as `typing.Shared`
      A type, compatible with pydantic, to indicate a shared value in
      annotations. Which type that corresponds to depends on the currently
      loaded symbolic library.
    + Tensor: retrieved as `typing.Tensor`
      A type, compatible with pydantic, corresponding to the union of
      Array, Symbolic and Shared types. (In other words, allowing both Numpy
      and symbolic inputs.)
    + AnyRNG: retrieved as `typing.AnyRNG`
      A type, compatible with pydantic, corresponding to eithen NumPy's
      RandomState or Theano's shared_RandomStream.RandomStream.
      Supports import/export to json.

Side-effects
------------
Importing this module also has the following side-effects:

  - Add the `shim` namespace to mackelab_toolbox.transform.Transforms.
    It points to 'theano_shim'.
  - Add a mapping from `float` (type) to `shim.config.floatX`
  - Add a mapping from 'floatX' (string) to `shim.config.floatX`
  - Prevent mackelab_toolbox.typing.Array from parsing computational graph types
