class GraphCache:
    """
    A cache which stores computational graphs on disk and which will flush
    itself whenever dependent code changes.
    This prevents that we retrieve the graphs constructed with old code.
    This class is used for caching graph transformations: both keys and values
    are graphs, respectively corresponding to the pre- and post-transformation
    graphs.
    More precisely: values are `(graph, updates)` tuples, where `updates` is
    an update dictionary.

    ..Note The behaviour when encountering errors can be adjusted by setting
    `GraphCache.on_cache_fail` (to modify all caches) or `cache.on_cache_fail`
    (to modify a specific cache `cache`). Possible values are:
        - 'ignore': Do nothing.
        - 'warn'  : Print a message with `logger.error`.
        - 'raise' : Raise a CachingError exception.
    The default setting of 'warn' ensures that failing to cache a graph does
    not prevent execution of otherwise functioning code.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cachename: str
        On-disk filename of the cache.
    *Classes: Types
        Class types. If any of these change, including types they inherit from,
        the on-disk cache will be cleared.
    modules: list of modules (keyword-only)
        List of modules which when changed, should invalidate a cache.
        If a module is imported as `import foo`, then pass it as
        `GraphCache([cachename], [classes], foo)`.
